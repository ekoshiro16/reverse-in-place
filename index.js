/*
Write an algorithm that accepts an array of characters and reverses the characters in place.

Note: An in-place algorithm is one that modifies the original input.
In an in-place algorithm, you may NOT create any additional variables that are arrays or objects. 
In-place algorithms may, however, use variables that are primitive data types (i.e. numbers, booleans, etc.)

For example:
For the input of ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'],
your algorithm would output ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'h']
